## Narrative: A Day in Emily’s Life
Emily kicks off her morning with a 20-minute yoga flow in her apartment, hoping to set a positive tone for the day. But by midday at work, after a flurry of meetings and deadlines, she’s dragging—her water bottle’s not cutting it, and she feels parched and mentally foggy. She knows proper hydration and electrolyte balance matter, but the sports drinks she’s tried either taste like candy or upset her stomach, and lugging bottled coconut water around isn’t practical with her packed schedule. Plus, the plastic waste nags at her eco-conscious side. During lunch, she scrolls Instagram, spotting @kayla_itsines touting a hydration hack, and flips through Well+Good for ideas, determined to find something that works.

Post-work, she heads to a fitness class or a quick run, but lately, she’s noticed her recovery’s off—she’s wiped out and prone to muscle cramps instead of feeling refreshed. She suspects dehydration and electrolyte imbalance are to blame, and it’s eating at her. She’s tried electrolyte tablets (too chalky), sports drinks (too sweet), and coconut water (too bulky), but nothing fits her life or her standards: natural, portable, effective for true rehydration. Emily’s on a mission for a solution that’s as driven as she is—one that keeps her optimally hydrated and recovered through her workouts and busy days, aligns with her clean-eating vibe, and lets her feel like the vibrant, unstoppable woman she knows she can be.
