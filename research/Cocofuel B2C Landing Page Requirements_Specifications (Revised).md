## Hero Section

**Purpose:** To instantly resonate with the user's core pain points (dehydration, fatigue, poor recovery) and present an aspirational vision of optimal hydration and vitality, immediately positioning Cocofuel as the key to unlocking their full potential through effective rehydration.

**Headline (H1):**
"Feeling Drained and Dehydrated? Reclaim Your Optimal Balance."

*   **Justification:** This headline directly addresses Emily's dominant negative emotions (dehydration, fatigue) and her biggest secret desire (to feel optimally hydrated and replenished). It uses second-person language ("Your") to create an immediate personal connection and offers an aspirational benefit ("Reclaim Your Optimal Balance"). It's action-oriented and emotionally charged, aligning with B2C best practices while focusing on rehydration rather than energy.

**Subtext (H2/Body):**
"Cocofuel is the natural, delicious way to rehydrate, replenish essential electrolytes, and recover faster. Say goodbye to dehydration and hello to your most vibrant, balanced self."

*   **Justification:** This subtext expands on the headline by introducing Cocofuel as the rehydration solution, highlighting key benefits (rehydrate, replenish electrolytes, recover faster) and directly contrasting them with Emily's frustrations (dehydration). It reinforces the aspirational outcome ("vibrant, balanced self") and uses positive, encouraging language. The mention of "natural, delicious" appeals to her values and complaints about existing sugary/artificial solutions.

**Imagery:**
*   **Type:** High-quality, authentic, and aspirational image or short video loop.
*   **Content:** A vibrant, active woman (similar to Emily Johnson) joyfully engaged in a post-workout recovery activity (e.g., stretching in a sunlit park, rehydrating after a hike with a clear, refreshed expression) with a Cocofuel product subtly visible. The setting should evoke nature, freshness, and recovery. The visual should convey replenishment, satisfaction, and optimal hydration.
*   **Emotional Connection:** The image should make the visitor imagine themselves experiencing the same positive recovery state and hydration that Cocofuel promises.
*   **Technical Specifications:** Optimized for fast loading. Consider implementing the Scroll Media Expansion Hero from 21st.dev for an immersive background experience.

**Call-to-Action (Primary Button):**
"Rehydrate Now!"

*   **Justification:** This CTA is action-oriented, uses urgency ("Now!"), and directly relates to the core benefit of rehydration. It's concise and clear, encouraging immediate action. The button should utilize Ocean Breeze or Coral Burst colors for high contrast and visual prominence.
*   **Placement:** Prominently displayed below the subtext, visually distinct and easily clickable.
*   **Microinteraction:** Implement the Interactive Hover Button effect with subtle scale and glow, plus consider the Scroll Media Expansion Hero for the background to create an immersive visual experience.

**Problem Section (Implicit within Hero):**
The Hero implicitly addresses Emily's core problem: feeling "drained," "dehydrated," and struggling with "poor recovery" and "inadequate rehydration" due to ineffective hydration solutions. The headline and subtext directly speak to these pain points, creating immediate relatability for the problem-aware avatar.

**Solution Section (Implicit within Hero):**
The Hero immediately positions Cocofuel as the rehydration solution to the identified problems. It promises to "Reclaim Your Optimal Balance," "rehydrate, replenish essential electrolytes, and recover faster," helping the user achieve their "most vibrant, balanced self."
